#Backend Learning Repository

This repository contains my learning journey in backend development using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, MySQL, EJS, and REST APIs. It includes various projects, exercises, and implementations that helped me understand backend technologies better.

##Technologies Used

Node.js - JavaScript runtime for server-side programming

Express.js - Lightweight web framework for building APIs and web applications

MongoDB - NoSQL database for handling dynamic data

MySQL - Relational database management system

EJS (Embedded JavaScript) - Templating engine for rendering dynamic HTML

REST API - Architectural style for building scalable APIs
